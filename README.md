TASK

Imagine that you are writing a program that represents the employees of a company.

There are common characteristics for each employee such as name, surname and department.

However, the role (position) of each employee may be different (For example, Software Developer, Project Manager, Sales Representative).

When we call the task method, each employee will say the job he/she has done on the console screen.

For example

Hasan Çıldırmış, the project manager of the company, appears on the console screen when the Gorev() abstract method is called.

We want it to print "I work as a project manager."
